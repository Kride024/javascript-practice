//? as the Document Object Model (DOM). This DOM tree represents the structure of the HTML document,with each HTML element
//? being a node in the tree.

//?This entire DOM tree is then accessible to Javascript as an object.JavaScript can interact with this object to
//? manipulate the content , structure, and style of the document dynamically.The DOM essentially serves as an interface
//? between the HTML document and JavaScript,providing a way for script to access and modify the document's structure and content.


//todo The Document Object Model(DOM) is an Application Programming Interface(API). The DOM Tree is the structure of your HTMl document,
//as represent by the DOM API. As stated, this API then gives us many method and properties that can use to manipulate the Tree,
// and therefore,by extension,the document.
